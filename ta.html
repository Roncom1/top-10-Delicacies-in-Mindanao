<h1>What is Tuna?</h1>
<p>Mindanao’s Tuna Cuisine tantalizes with its Grilled Tuna Belly, showcasing the rich flavors of abundant local tuna. Carefully marinated in local herbs and spices, this succulent dish is a mouthwatering experience. Grilled over an open flame, the tuna belly retains its juiciness with a smoky, charred exterior. Each bite offers tender, melt-in-your-mouth flesh bursting with the distinct taste of Mindanao’s pristine waters. Served with aromatic jasmine rice and a tangy soy-based dipping sauce, this grilled tuna belly is a must-try for seafood enthusiasts and connoisseurs.</p>

<h3>Ingredients : </h3>
<li>Olive oil – Evoo (extra virgin olive oil) all the way for me. It helps keep the tuna from sticking to the grill and helps keep the marinade on the tuna steak.
<li>Honey – A touch of sweet is all you need in this tuna steak recipe.
<li>Minced garlic – Mince your own garlic or use minced garlic from a jar.
<li>Cilantro – Use freshly chopped cilantro, it tastes so good and works better than dried.
<li>Parsley – Fresh parsley is great in this recipe, just chop finely and add to the bag with the rest of the marinade.
<li>Salt and coarsely cracked black pepper – Just a little salt and pepper is all you need in this tuna steak seasoning.
<li>Cumin – Any brand of cumin will work in this recipe for grilled tuna.
<li>Smoked paprika – Smoked paprika adds a lovely flavor to this marinade. But if you only have regular paprika that’s okay too.
<li>Lemon juice – You’ll need the juice from about half a lemon. I swear by fresh-squeezed lemon juice because it just takes much more tart and lemony. But you can use bottled in a pinch.

<h3>Instructions : </h3> 
<li>First step is the easiest: Combine all of the marinade ingredients (yep, all of them!) and whisk vigorously. (photo 1)
<li>Next, place the tuna steaks in a gallon Ziploc bag, then, pour in the marinade toss to coat the tuna steaks, and press out the excess air and seal. (Alternately, you can put the tuna steaks in a bowl, add the marinade, toss, cover and let marinade in the bowl.) (photo 2)
<li>Transfer the tuna steak marinade to the fridge and chill for 30 minutes.
<li>Take the tuna steak out of the fridge and put it on the grill, cooking for 6-8 minutes on each side, or till the tuna is easily flaked with a fork and the center of the tuna steak is just barely pink. (The internal temperature of the tuna steak should read 90-95 degrees when done.)
