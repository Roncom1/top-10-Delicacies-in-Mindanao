<h1>What is Chicken Piyangyang?</h1>

<p > Pyanggang Chicken comes from the Tausug tribe of Mindanao, Philippines, and is a dish that is traditionally stewed in its flavorful sauce, then finished on the grill. For this article, it is being presented as a straight grilled dish. What makes it unique is its use of palapa itum, a type of aromatic spice paste (think of it as a sofrito) used to flavor various dishes. And integral to this sofrito is an even more unique ingredient: burnt coconut meat. Not toasted, singed, or browned, but burnt.<br>
This burnt meat, extracted from the coconut shell as nearly a powder, gives a surprisingly deep and nutty flavor to the unique spice paste. </p>

<h3>Instructions : </h3>
<oltype = number>
<li>Method for burnt coconut flesh:If you can get your coconut market vendor to separate the flesh from the husk, discard the husks and burn the flesh directly over your charcoal grill until black on both sides—burnt. If you can t get them separated, break niyog in half or quarters then burn all sides directly over charcoal until you can separate the husk and then continue to burn the flesh until burnt black on both sides.
<li>Grind the burnt coconut flesh in a food processor or use a mortar and pestle. Use as needed.
<li>To make the paste: combine burnt coconut, red onion, lemongrass stalk, fresh turmeric, garlic, ginger, cilantro stems, spring onions, canola oil, and green chili (optional) and pound on a mortar and pestle. Mix well until you have a paste. Season to taste. Take half of the paste and combine  with the chicken, mix well and marinate for about 4 hours.
<li>Heat oil in a pan over medium high heat and sear the chicken on all sides until lightly brown then remove the chicken from the pan. On the same pan, sauté garlic, onions, lemongrass, ginger, patis, and the rest of the paste.
<li>Add coconut milk and coconut cream and bring to a slow simmer. Return the chicken to the pan and bring to a slow boil then maintain at a simmer for 12 minutes or so or until the chicken is cooked through. Season to taste. Add green chilies to the paste or sauté for heat, if desired.
