<h1>What is Rendang?</h1>

<p>Rendang is a delicious beef stew that originated in  Indo. It was brought to the Philippines by the Maranao people and can be found in various places in Mindanao and even downtown Quiapo in Manila.
Filipino rendang is drier than the original recipe in Indonesia. It also uses palapa (a Maranao condiment made of toasted coconut and other ingredients) combined with muscovado sugar and is cooked similar to that of adobo. The resulting dish is sweet, spicy, and delicious.

Whether youre a fan of the original rendang or youre trying this dish for the first time, Filipino rendang is one of the Mindanao food you shouldn t miss.</p>
