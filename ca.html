<h1>What is Curacha?</h1>

<p>The name 'curacha' comes from the Chavacano language and refers to a species of deep-sea crab that can typically be discovered in the waters of Sulu and Zamboanga City. Curacha is one of the most famous seafood delights found in Zamboanga, and it is a delicacy that is much sought after by both locals and tourists.
This bright orange crustacean is sometimes referred to as â€œred frog crab, It is typically steamed or boiled before being served with a thick, sweet orange sauce made with coconut cream and secret spices. The recipe for this sauce was popularized by a local restaurant called Alavar Seafood Restaurant.
Curacha is a much softer and meatier crab than the usual ones bought in markets. The best curacha is served at the Alavar Seafood Restaurant, filled with their secret sauce.</p>
