<h1>What is tuyulaitum?</h1>

<p>Tiyula Itum is a Filipino beef soup prepared with beef or goat pieces that were cooked with lemongrass, ginger, turmeric and charred coconut meat.Its black like dinuguan but it does not contain any blood, so where does this dish take its colour from? Burnt Coconut Meat, it may sound weird and you may get intimidated by the looks, but that burnt coconut adds a nice depth to this dish. Not convinced yet? we’ll have you tried or even heard the Charcoal Ramen or Black Ramen? Now with that thought it will be more palatable, don’t you think, because it is a more common dish than our recipe for today. The black colour from the ramens basically is made up with burnt ingredients like bamboo, garlic and miso, like this dish it is made with burnt coconut meat and like the ramens its primary reason is to give a nice depth in flavour.
