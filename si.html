<h1>What is Satti?</h1>
<p>Satti is a breakfast staple predominantly found in Zamboanga, but it also served in other provinces such as Sulu, Basilan, and Tawi-Tawi.

This flavorful dish is made of marinated skewered meat (usually beef, chicken, or seafood) grilled to perfection and then served with a bowl of hot, spicy sauce thats rich with flavors of cumin, turmeric, and a variety of local spices. Its served with an accompanying bowl of rice soaked in the same spicy sauce.
Aside from its taste, another great thing about satti is that it is cheap and can be found in many eateries.</p>
